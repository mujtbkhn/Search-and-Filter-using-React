## Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced Searching and Filtering using ReactJS** project! This project showcases a dynamic product page for an imaginary e-commerce shoe website. It utilizes ReactJS to create a powerful and user-friendly interface for searching, filtering, and displaying products. Whether you're building an online store or just want to learn about advanced filtering techniques, this project is a great resource.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: A search input at the top allows users to search for products based on keywords. The search is performed dynamically without the need for a full page reload.

- **Filtering Options**: The left sidebar provides various filtering options, including categories, colors, and prices. Users can filter products based on their preferences, making it easy to find the perfect pair of shoes.

- **Recommended Products**: A "Recommended Products" section is displayed below the search input, suggesting products based on the user's search query and selected filters.

- **Product Cards**: Each product card on the page includes essential details such as product titles, ratings, previous prices (`prevPrice`), and new prices (`newPrice`). Users can quickly compare products and make informed decisions.
